NB: 
In the "develop" branch, there is an updated version of the formalization where 
- "infer" is closer to the on-paper formulation, and
- the directory is better structured. 

USAGE DIRECTIVES:

The formalization is performed with Coq 8.12.1 with the ssreflect extension.

To compile the formalization on a *nix platform, run

make

To compile the formalization on a Windows platform,
invoke coqc on the following files in order:

sem.v tactics.v arith.v while.v while_ext.v fun.v

Then, it should be possible to step through the proof scripts in Proof General.


CONTENT OF THE DIRECTORY:

arith.v    -- lemmas about arithmetic operations on natural numbers and integers
lists.v	   -- lemmas about list operations
tactics.v  -- custom tactics
sem.v	   -- formalization of the technique, with proofs on its soundness and relative completeness
while.v	   -- formalization of the While language and the verification of the factorial program
while_ext.v -- formalization of the extended While language and the verification of the array-merging program
fun.v	    -- formalization of the eager functional language and the verification of the list-merging program
